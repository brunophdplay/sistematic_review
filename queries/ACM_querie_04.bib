	abstract = {Design thinking is now gaining popularity in K12 education, but the elements influencing the design thinking process are still ambiguous. In this research, we conducted a great deal of work to explore the key elements of design thinking tools. First, we choose paper tools for the prototype of our experiment, to find out the design thinking mode of high school students. Second, we used the keywords analysis system to extract keywords and to analyze the thinking process. The result showed that starting with storytelling and cooperating with technical needs is more suitable for students to develop their innovative thinking.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a design approach to build casual games by children for children. Children understand game narratives with previously acquired schemata that is different from adults. Hence, integrating narrative developed by children themselves into game design may serve the children well. Using a narrative approach to game design based on informant design methods, the proposed approach aims to maximize the contribution of both children informants and adult designers. It comprises of three major phases, namely Narrative Design, Game Design and Design Moderation. A mobile phone game was developed based on this approach. User testing revealed that the children generally enjoyed the game and that the proposed approach has promising potential in empowering the child designers. Future work will focus on further evaluation of the approach for refinement.},

In this paper, I outline Black feminist technoscience as a framework that bridges Black feminism and feminist technoscience in order to connect its critical theory that unpacks power and liberation through the lived experiences of Black women to work in feminist technoscience that has produced important critical scholarship on design and technology. Shifting our focus to Black women heightens our understanding of the transgressive systems embedded in design and opportunities to transform it. I explore core principles of Black feminist technoscience, including intersectionality, coming to voice, the personal and situated, (Black) temporalities, (em)bodied ecologies and the ethics of care. Finally, I present Black feminist technoscience as a praxis that is grounded in storytelling as a method for reworking design.},

The primary challenge in making Metroverse stems from the complexity of the underlying research and data, both of which need to be effectively communicated to a wide range of end-users with different backgrounds. To unravel the complexity of the research, and to design the platform, we followed a user-centered design process. Our design process brought together researchers, designers, and various end-users, who collectively guided the design of the narrative visualization. Engaging end-users in the early phases of the project allowed us to identify the valuable insights in the data and subsequently design effective visualizations that convey those insights. We believe findings from our process can provide a template for similar projects that require translating complex research data and methodologies into user-friendly story structures.},

	abstract = {While many technology-based approaches to support people living with HIV target specific clinical goals, recent work has begun to consider how to design support in the context of HIV stigma. Here, we consider two challenges; the first, and central challenge is how to work with a small group of stakeholders to design for the much larger, but hard to access, population of HIV-positive individuals. Addressing the first challenge, we introduce the Narrative Tapestry design process, which is our main contribution, and helps create a generative third space wherein stakeholders draw on their cultural knowledge to reflect on common experiences of living with HIV. The second challenge is how to design a platform that is less likely to disintegrate as people transition through phases of living with a stigmatized identity. Applying the Narrative Tapestry process led us to insights that both demonstrate the value of the design process and partially address this second challenge. We find that social support can be a critical lifeline following an HIV diagnosis, but that when people have normalized their identity, this need can give way to a desire to address stigma directly. We propose combining social support tools with a set of features that enable people to work as change-agents to address stigma in their local communities. We argue that this type of platform would help to retain senior members who can serve both as community caretakers as well as role models for newcomers.},

Research has also shown humans are alienated from nature, which is of great concern, especially for children, whose well-being should be society's top priority. Child–computer interaction (CCI) research is among the disciplines that should examine nature and natural rhythm in children's lives from the perspective of digital technology. We build a multidisciplinary theoretical framework on nature and natural rhythm with which to review the extant CCI literature. We discuss the state of the art and identify paths for future work. We show that in CCI research, being in nature and catering to nature have been addressed, while less attention has been paid to children being part of nature and its natural rhythm. We discuss how CCI research and design can acknowledge and better support such aspects.},

A common part of the work is committee review, where individual reviewers meet to discuss the merits of a particular submission in order to recommend an accept or reject decision. Prior work indicates that visualization and sensemaking support may be beneficial in such processes where reviewers must present the "story" of the applicant under question. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with reviewers in the domain of holistic college admissions to better understand the challenges and opportunities regarding storytelling. Based on these workshops, we contribute a characterization for how reviewers in this domain construct visual stories, we provide guidance for designing for evidence capture and storytelling, and we draw parallels and distinctions between this domain and other reviewing domains.},

While augmenting such public visualizations with a narrative design strategy could be promising to engage a lay audience, they might perform differently on public displays than on common online media because of the more context-sensitive environment. We therefore report on a comparative in-the-wild study of a public display that contrasts an identical public visualization with and without a narrative structure, and unravel how this affects the user engagement and insight creation process. Our findings indicate how a narrative strategy in relation to contextual aspects supports deeper, more personal reflection on data, connects authorship to the surrounding environment, and overcomes comprehension issues. We believe these results are useful for making public visualizations more effective, as well as understanding why and how lay users interact with and learn from narrative data visualization in general.},

The size of sample group was specified by the formula of Cochran (1996). The sample group which was measured through the questionnaire was the primary school teachers for 432 people and upper primary students for 612 people which affiliated with the Office of the Basic Education Commission of 4 regions in Thailand. The sample group which was measured by interview method consisted of the upper primary students for 10 people and experts for 7 people. Lastly, the sample group which was measured by the evaluation forms was 5 experts. The research result presented that the state and needs of mostly teacher and student was the ability of using the website device such as Social Media Search Engine Documentation Presentation Online.

One question that is raised is: Within the limits of technologies, to what extent, can we integrate narratives in media architecture to fabricate a comprehensive user experience, through which the building's characteristics are better represented and the branding message better delivered? This paper then, endeavors to find answers and solutions to this challenge within three case studies of ongoing media architecture projects, in which the narrative methodologies are integrated with interactive digital media design.},
