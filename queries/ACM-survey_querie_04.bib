	abstract = {Narratives are fundamental to our understanding of the world, providing us with a natural structure for knowledge representation over time. Computational narrative extraction is a subfield of artificial intelligence that makes heavy use of information retrieval and natural language processing techniques. Despite the importance of computational narrative extraction, relatively little scholarly work exists on synthesizing previous research and strategizing future research in the area. In particular, this article focuses on extracting news narratives from an event-centric perspective. Extracting narratives from news data has multiple applications in understanding the evolving information landscape. This survey presents an extensive study of research in the area of event-based news narrative extraction. In particular, we screened more than 900 articles, which yielded 54 relevant articles. These articles are synthesized and organized by representation model, extraction criteria, and evaluation approaches. Based on the reviewed studies, we identify recent trends, open challenges, and potential research lines.},

In our survey, we reviewed 149 related articles (81.2\% of articles published between 2019 and 2023) covering architectural design, 3D shape techniques, and virtual environments. Through scrutinizing the literature, we first identify the principles of virtual architecture and illuminate its current production challenges, including datasets, multimodality, design intuition, and generative frameworks. We then introduce the latest approaches to designing and generating virtual buildings leveraging 3D shape generation and summarize four characteristics of various approaches to virtual architecture. Based on our analysis, we expound on four research agendas, including agency, communication, user consideration, and integrating tools. Additionally, we highlight four important enablers of ubiquitous interaction with immersive systems in deep learning-assisted architectural generation. Our work contributes to fostering understanding between designers and deep learning techniques, broadening access to designer-AI collaboration. We advocate for interdisciplinary efforts to address this timely research topic, facilitating content designing and generation in the virtual environment.},

A number of narrative-related problems can be addressed automatically through the analysis of character networks, such as summarization, classification, or role detection. Character networks are particularly relevant when considering works of fiction (e.g., novels, plays, movies, TV series), as their exploitation allows developing information retrieval and recommendation systems. However, works of fiction possess specific properties that make these tasks harder.This survey aims at presenting and organizing the scientific literature related to the extraction of character networks from works of fiction, as well as their analysis. We first describe the extraction process in a generic way and explain how its constituting steps are implemented in practice, depending on the medium of the narrative, the goal of the network analysis, and other factors. We then review the descriptive tools used to characterize character networks, with a focus on the way they are interpreted in this context. We illustrate the relevance of character networks by also providing a review of applications derived from their analysis. Finally, we identify the limitations of the existing approaches and the most promising perspectives.},

In Conversational Search Systems (CSS) like chatbots and Virtual Personal Assistants such as Apple’s Siri, Amazon Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Google Assistant, both user and device have a limited platform to communicate through chatting or voice. In the information-seeking process, often users do not know how to properly describe their information need in a machine understandable language. Consequently, it is hard for the assistant agent to predict the user’s intent and yield relevant results by only relying on the original query. Studies have shown many unsatisfactory results can be enhanced with the benefit of CSS, which can dig deeper into the user’s query to reveal the real need. This survey intends to provide a comprehensive and comparative overview of ambiguous query clarification task in the context of conversational search technology. We investigate different approaches, their evaluation methods, and future work. We also address the importance of understanding a query for retrieving the most relevant document(s) and satisfying user’s need by predicting their potential request. This work provides an overview of characteristics of ambiguous queries and contributes to better understanding of the existing technologies and challenges in CSS focus on disambiguation of unclear queries from various dimensions.},

This review proposes a unified framework to provide a general understanding of the building blocks of medical coding models and summarizes recent advanced models under the proposed framework. Our unified framework decomposes medical coding into four main components, i.e., encoder modules for text feature extraction, mechanisms for building deep encoder architectures, decoder modules for transforming hidden representations into medical codes, and the usage of auxiliary information. Finally, we introduce the benchmarks and real-world usage and discuss key research challenges and future directions.},

No standardized methodology exists to conduct subjective quality assessments of multisensorial media applications. To date, researchers have employed different aspects of audiovisual standards to assess user QoE of multisensorial media applications and thus, a fragmented approach exists. In this article, the authors highlight issues researchers face from numerous perspectives including applicability (or lack of) existing audiovisual standards to evaluate user QoE and lack of result comparability due to varying approaches, specific requirements of olfactory-based multisensorial media applications, and novelty associated with these applications. Finally, based on the diverse approaches in the literature and the collective experience of authors, this article provides a tutorial and recommendations on the key steps to conduct olfactory-based multisensorial media QoE evaluation.},

As such, there is no systematic way for software engineers to choose among decision-making techniques for resolving tradeoffs in architecture design. In this article, we provide a comparison of existing decision-making techniques, aimed to guide architects in their selection. The results show that there is no “best” decision-making technique; however, some techniques are more susceptible to specific difficulties. Hence architects should choose a decision-making technique based on the difficulties that they wish to avoid.

Fully synthetic data, which transcends anonymisation, may be the key to unlocking valuable untapped insights stored away in secured data vaults. This review examines current synthetic data generation methods and their utility measurement. We found that more traditional generative models such as Classification and Regression Tree models alongside Bayesian Networks remain highly relevant and are still capable of surpassing deep learning alternatives like Generative Adversarial Networks. However, our findings also display the same lack of agreement on metrics for evaluation, uncovered in earlier reviews, posing a persistent obstacle to advancing the field. We propose a tool for evaluating the utility of synthetic data and illustrate how it can be applied to three synthetic data generation models. By streamlining evaluation and promoting agreement on metrics, researchers can explore novel methods and generate compelling results that will convince data curators and lawmakers to embrace synthetic data. Our review emphasises the potential of synthetic data and highlights the need for greater collaboration and standardisation to unlock its full potential.},

This manuscript provides a characterization of the application of gamification to the Software Testing area. Such practice in fact reportedly suffers from low engagement by both personnel in industrial contexts and learners in educational contexts. Our goal is to identify the application areas and utilized gamified techniques and mechanics, the provided benefits and drawbacks, as well as the open challenges in the field. To this purpose, we conducted a Multivocal Literature Review to identify white and grey literature sources addressing gamified software testing.We analyzed 73 contributions and summarized the most common gamified mechanics, concepts, tools, and domains where they are mostly applied. We conclude that gamification in software testing is mostly applied to the test creation phase with simple white-box unit or mutation testing tools and is mostly used to foster good behaviors by promoting the testers’ accomplishment. Key research areas and main challenges in the field are: careful design of tailored gamified mechanics for specific testing techniques; the need for technological improvements to enable crowdsourcing, cooperation, and concurrency; the necessity for empirical and large-scale evaluation of the benefits delivered by gamification mechanics.},

	abstract = {Question-answering systems are recognized as popular and frequently effective means of information seeking on the web. In such systems, information seekers can receive a concise response to their queries by presenting their questions in natural language. Interactive question answering is a recently proposed and increasingly popular solution that resides at the intersection of question answering and dialogue systems. On the one hand, the user can ask questions in normal language and locate the actual response to her inquiry; on the other hand, the system can prolong the question-answering session into a dialogue if there are multiple probable replies, very few, or ambiguities in the initial request. By permitting the user to ask more questions, interactive question answering enables users to interact with the system and receive more precise results dynamically.This survey offers a detailed overview of the interactive question-answering methods that are prevalent in current literature. It begins by explaining the foundational principles of question-answering systems, hence defining new notations and taxonomies to combine all identified works inside a unified framework. The reviewed published work on interactive question-answering systems is then presented and examined in terms of its proposed methodology, evaluation approaches, and dataset/application domain. We also describe trends surrounding specific tasks and issues raised by the community, so shedding light on the future interests of scholars.

To address this issue, we conducted a systematic review, deeply analyzing the impact of AE on security and safety, and comparing it with the current in-vehicle communication solutions like Controller Area Network protocol. We retrieved the key security attacks and mitigations proposed in the current literature to highlight their significance, including a mapping between the regulation UNECE WP.29 R155 and the retrieved answers.

	abstract = {Strategic Decision-Making is always challenging because it is inherently uncertain, ambiguous, risky, and complex. By contrast to tactical and operational decisions, strategic decisions are decisive, pivotal, and often irreversible, which may result in long-term and significant consequences. A strategic decision-making process usually involves many aspects of inquiry, including sensory perception, deliberative thinking, inquiry-based analysis, meta-learning, and constant interaction with the external world. Many unknowns, unpredictabilities, and environmental constraints will shape every aspect of a strategic decision. Traditionally, this task often relies on intuition, reflective thinking, visionary insights, approximate estimates, and practical wisdom. With recent advances in artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) technologies, we can leverage AI/ML to support strategic decision-making. However, there is still a substantial gap from an AI perspective due to inadequate models, despite the tremendous progress made. We argue that creating a comprehensive taxonomy of decision frames as a representation space is essential for AI because it could offer surprising insights beyond anyone's imaginary boundary today. Strategic decision-making is the art of possibility. This study develops a systematic taxonomy of decision-making frames that consists of six bases, 18 categorical, and 54 elementary frames. We formulate the model using the inquiry method based on Bloom's taxonomy approach. We aim to lay out the computational foundation that is possible to capture a comprehensive landscape view of a strategic problem. Compared with many traditional models, this novel taxonomy covers irrational, non-rational and rational frames capable of dealing with certainty, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity, chaos, and ignorance.},

Then, we show the major challenges that have arisen in these aspects, as well as possible solutions for them. We also include a summary of various useful resources and typical text generation applications based on PLMs. Finally, we highlight the future research directions which will further improve these PLMs for text generation.

When these systems implement a conversational component to interact with users, they are also known as conversational agents or chatbots.

Despite their exciting potential, which has been further enhanced by the advent of Generative AI and Large Language Models, bots still face challenges in terms of development and integration into the development cycle, as practitioners report that bots can add difficulties rather than provide improvements. In this work, we aim to provide a taxonomy for characterizing bots, as well as a series of challenges for their adoption in software engineering, accompanied by potential mitigation strategies. To achieve our objectives, we conducted a multivocal literature review, examining both research and practitioner literature. Through such an approach, we hope to contribute to both researchers and practitioners by providing (i) a series of future research directions to pursue, (ii) a list of strategies to adopt for improving the use of bots for software engineering purposes, and (iii) fostering technology and knowledge transfer from the research field to practice—one of the primary goals of multivocal literature reviews.},

We present a functional taxonomy for music generation systems with reference to existing systems. The taxonomy organizes systems according to the purposes for which they were designed. It also reveals the inter-relatedness amongst the systems. This design-centered approach contrasts with predominant methods-based surveys and facilitates the identification of grand challenges to set the stage for new breakthroughs.},

Given the societal risks of unvetted content-moderating algorithms for Extremism, Radicalisation, and Hate speech (ERH) detection, responsible software engineering must understand the who, what, when, where, and why such models are necessary to protect user safety and free expression. Hence, we propose and examine the unique research field of ERH context mining to unify disjoint studies. Specifically, we evaluate the start-to-finish design process from socio-technical definition-building and dataset collection strategies to technical algorithm design and performance. Our 2015–2021 51-study Systematic Literature Review (SLR) provides the first cross-examination of textual, network, and visual approaches to detecting extremist affiliation, hateful content, and radicalisation towards groups and movements. We identify consensus-driven ERH definitions and propose solutions to existing ideological and geographic biases, particularly due to the lack of research in Oceania/Australasia. Our hybridised investigation on Natural Language Processing, Community Detection, and visual-text models demonstrates the dominating performance of textual transformer-based algorithms. We conclude with vital recommendations for ERH context mining researchers and propose an uptake roadmap with guidelines for researchers, industries, and governments to enable a safer cyberspace.},

User-centered misinformation interventions as digital countermeasures that exert a direct influence on users represent a promising means to deal with the large amounts of information available. While an extensive body of research on this topic exists, researchers are confronted with a diverse research landscape spanning multiple disciplines. This review systematizes the landscape of user-centered misinformation interventions to facilitate knowledge transfer, identify trends, and enable informed decision-making. Over 6,000 scholarly publications were screened, and a systematic literature review (N=172) was conducted. A taxonomy was derived regarding intervention design (e.g., labels, showing indicators of misinformation, corrections, removal, or visibility reduction of content), user interaction (active or passive), and timing (e.g., pre or post exposure to misinformation or on request of the user). We provide a structured overview of approaches across multiple disciplines and derive six overarching challenges for future research regarding transferability of approaches to (1) novel platforms and (2) emerging video- and image-based misinformation, the sensible combination of automated mechanisms with (3) human experts and (4) user-centered feedback to facilitate comprehensibility, (5) encouraging media literacy without misinformation exposure, and (6) adequately addressing particularly vulnerable users such as older people or adolescents.},

The potential for this success to continue and accelerate has placed machine learning (ML) at the top of research, economic, and political agendas. Such unprecedented interest is fuelled by a vision of ML applicability extending to healthcare, transportation, defence, and other domains of great societal importance. Achieving this vision requires the use of ML in safety-critical applications that demand levels of assurance beyond those needed for current ML applications. Our article provides a comprehensive survey of the state of the art in the assurance of ML, i.e., in the generation of evidence that ML is sufficiently safe for its intended use. The survey covers the methods capable of providing such evidence at different stages of the machine learning lifecycle, i.e., of the complex, iterative process that starts with the collection of the data used to train an ML component for a system, and ends with the deployment of that component within the system. The article begins with a systematic presentation of the ML lifecycle and its stages. We then define assurance desiderata for each stage, review existing methods that contribute to achieving these desiderata, and identify open challenges that require further research.},

Additionally, theoretical proofs have illuminated their emergent reasoning capabilities, providing a compelling showcase of their advanced cognitive abilities in linguistic contexts. Critical to their remarkable efficacy in handling complex reasoning tasks, LLMs leverage the intriguing chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning techniques, obliging them to formulate intermediate steps en route to deriving an answer. The CoT reasoning approach has not only exhibited proficiency in amplifying reasoning performance but also in enhancing interpretability, controllability, and flexibility. In light of these merits, recent research endeavors have extended CoT reasoning methodologies to nurture the development of autonomous language agents, which adeptly adhere to language instructions and execute actions within varied environments. This survey paper orchestrates a thorough discourse, penetrating vital research dimensions, encompassing: (i) the foundational mechanics of CoT techniques, with a focus on elucidating the circumstances and justification behind its efficacy; (ii) the paradigm shift in CoT; and (iii) the burgeoning of language agents fortified by CoT approaches. Prospective research avenues envelop explorations into generalization, efficiency, customization, scaling, and safety.

It is regarded as crucial for the development of advanced text generation technologies that better meet the specific constraints in practical applications. In recent years, methods using large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs), in particular the widely used Transformer-based PLMs, have become a new paradigm of NLG, allowing generation of more diverse and fluent text. However, due to the limited level of interpretability of deep neural networks, the controllability of these methods needs to be guaranteed. To this end, controllable text generation using Transformer-based PLMs has become a rapidly growing yet challenging new research hotspot. A diverse range of approaches have emerged in the past 3 to 4 years, targeting different CTG tasks that require different types of controlled constraints. In this article, we present a systematic critical review on the common tasks, main approaches, and evaluation methods in this area. Finally, we discuss the challenges that the field is facing, and put forward various promising future directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey article to summarize the state-of-the-art CTG techniques from the perspective of Transformer-based PLMs. We hope it can help researchers and practitioners in the related fields to quickly track the academic and technological frontier, providing them with a landscape of the area and a roadmap for future research.},

The idea is to explicitly model part-whole hierarchies by using groups of neurons called capsules to encode visual entities, then learn the relationships between these entities dynamically from data. However, a major hurdle for capsule network research has been the lack of a reliable point of reference for understanding their foundational ideas and motivations. This survey provides a comprehensive and critical overview of capsule networks, which aims to serve as a main point of reference going forward. To that end, we introduce the fundamental concepts and motivations behind capsule networks, such as equivariant inference. We then cover various technical advances in capsule routing algorithms as well as alternative geometric and generative formulations. We provide a detailed explanation of how capsule networks relate to the attention mechanism in Transformers and uncover non-trivial conceptual similarities between them in the context of object-centric representation learning. We also review the extensive applications of capsule networks in computer vision, video and motion, graph representation learning, natural language processing, medical imaging, and many others.

	abstract = {Capsule networks emerged as a promising alternative to convolutional neural networks for learning object-centric representations. The idea is to explicitly model part-whole hierarchies by using groups of neurons called capsules to encode visual entities, then learn the relationships between these entities dynamically from data. However, a major hurdle for capsule network research has been the lack of a reliable point of reference for understanding their foundational ideas and motivations. This survey provides a comprehensive and critical overview of capsule networks, which aims to serve as a main point of reference going forward. To that end, we introduce the fundamental concepts and motivations behind capsule networks, such as equivariant inference. We then cover various technical advances in capsule routing algorithms as well as alternative geometric and generative formulations. We provide a detailed explanation of how capsule networks relate to the attention mechanism in Transformers and uncover non-trivial conceptual similarities between them in the context of object-centric representation learning. We also review the extensive applications of capsule networks in computer vision, video and motion, graph representation learning, natural language processing, medical imaging, and many others. To conclude, we provide an in-depth discussion highlighting promising directions for future work.},

As a result, people tend to utilize visual content to capture and share their life experiences, which greatly facilitates the transfer of information. Meanwhile, it also increases the risk of privacy violations, e.g., an image or video can reveal different kinds of privacy-sensitive information. Scholars have persistently pursued the advancement of tailored privacy protection measures. Various surveys attempt to consolidate these efforts from specific viewpoints. Nevertheless, these surveys tend to focus on particular issues, scenarios, or technologies, hindering a comprehensive overview of existing solutions on a broader scale. In this survey, a framework that encompasses various concerns and solutions for visual privacy is proposed, which allows for a macro understanding of privacy concerns from a comprehensive level. It is based on the fact that privacy concerns have corresponding adversaries, and divides privacy protection into three categories, based on computer vision (CV) adversary, based on human vision (HV) adversary, and based on CV \& HV adversary. For each category, we analyze the characteristics of the main approaches to privacy protection, and then systematically review representative solutions. Open challenges and future directions for visual privacy protection are also discussed.},

An automatic summarization system that can effectively condense long documents into short and concise texts to encapsulate the most important information would thus be significant in aiding the reader’s comprehension. Recently, with the advent of neural architectures, significant research efforts have been made to advance automatic text summarization systems, and numerous studies on the challenges of extending these systems to the long document domain have emerged. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the research on long document summarization and a systematic evaluation across the three principal components of its research setting: benchmark datasets, summarization models, and evaluation metrics. For each component, we organize the literature within the context of long document summarization and conduct an empirical analysis to broaden the perspective on current research progress. The empirical analysis includes a study on the intrinsic characteristics of benchmark datasets, a multi-dimensional analysis of summarization models, and a review of the summarization evaluation metrics. Based on the overall findings, we conclude by proposing possible directions for future exploration in this rapidly growing field.},

We then focus on various modelling approaches and assessment strategies, leading us to discussing some challenges in this field, and suggesting some potential directions for future research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey that summarizes the progress of FLG including the most recent development in NLP. We also organize corresponding resources, e.g., article lists and datasets, and make them accessible in an open repository.

Today, such videos are often produced by professionals, which is a time-, labour- and cost-intensive undertaking. In order to produce such contents to support large applications (e.g., e-commerce), the field of artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered persuasive video generation (AIPVG) has gained traction in recent years. This field is interdisciplinary in nature, which makes it challenging for new researchers to grasp. Currently, there is no comprehensive survey of AIPVG available. In this paper, we bridge this gap by reviewing key AI techniques that can be utilized to automatically generate persuasive videos. We offer a first-of-its-kind taxonomy which divides AIPVG into three major steps: (1) visual material understanding, which extracts information from the visual materials (VMs) relevant to the target of promotion; (2) visual storyline generation, which shortlists and arranges high-quality VMs into a sequence in order to compose a storyline with persuasive power; and (3) post-production, which involves background music generation and still image animation to enhance viewing experience. We also introduce the evaluation metrics and datasets commonly adopted in the field of AIPVG. We analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the existing works belonging to the above-mentioned steps, and discuss interesting potential future research directions.},

However, despite the significant multi-disciplinary research advances, current medical search systems exhibit low levels of performance. This survey provides an overview of the state of the art in the disciplines of IR and health informatics, and bridging these disciplines shows how semantic search techniques can facilitate medical IR.

As the advent of cloud computing has supported renting resources on-demand, it is of great interest to review the research progress of hosting streaming systems in clouds under certain Service Level Agreements (SLA) and cost constraints. In this article, we introduce the hierarchical structure of streaming systems, define the scope of the resource management problem, and present a comprehensive taxonomy in this context covering critical research topics such as resource provisioning, operator parallelisation, and task scheduling. The literature is then reviewed following the taxonomy structure, facilitating a deeper understanding of the research landscape through classification and comparison of existing works. Finally, we discuss the open issues and future research directions toward realising an automatic, SLA-aware resource management framework.},

	abstract = {Modern graphics processing units (GPUs) have complex architectures that admit exceptional performance and energy efficiency for high-throughput applications. Although GPUs consume large amounts of power, their use for high-throughput applications facilitate state-of-the-art energy efficiency and performance. Consequently, continued development relies on understanding their power consumption. This work is a survey of GPU power modeling and profiling methods with increased detail on noteworthy efforts. As direct measurement of GPU power is necessary for model evaluation and parameter initiation, internal and external power sensors are discussed. Hardware counters, which are low-level tallies of hardware events, share strong correlation to power use and performance. Statistical correlation between power and performance counters has yielded worthwhile GPU power models, yet the complexity inherent to GPU architectures presents new hurdles for power modeling. Developments and challenges of counter-based GPU power modeling are discussed. Often building on the counter-based models, research efforts for GPU power simulation, which make power predictions from input code and hardware knowledge, provide opportunities for optimization in programming or architectural design. Noteworthy strides in power simulations for GPUs are included along with their performance or functional simulator counterparts when appropriate. Last, possible directions for future research are discussed.},

Many GAN models have been proposed, and several practical applications have emerged in various domains of computer vision and machine learning. Despite GANs excellent success, there are still obstacles to stable training. The problems are Nash equilibrium, internal covariate shift, mode collapse, vanishing gradient, and lack of proper evaluation metrics. Therefore, stable training is a crucial issue in different applications for the success of GANs. Herein, we survey several training solutions proposed by different researchers to stabilize GAN training. We discuss (I) the original GAN model and its modified versions, (II) a detailed analysis of various GAN applications in different domains, and (III) a detailed study about the various GAN training obstacles as well as training solutions.

In recent years, DRL has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in various tasks, including video games, robotic control, quantitative trading, and autonomous driving. Despite its accomplishments, security and privacy-related issues still prevent us from deploying trustworthy DRL applications. For example, by manipulating the environment, an attacker can influence an agent’s actions, misleading it to behave abnormally. Additionally, an attacker can infer private training data and environmental information by maliciously interacting with DRL models, causing a privacy breach. In this survey, we systematically investigate the recent progress of security and privacy issues in the context of DRL. First, we present a holistic review of security-related attacks within DRL systems from the perspectives of single-agent and multi-agent systems and review privacy-related attacks. Second, we review and classify defense methods used to address security-related challenges, including robust learning, anomaly detection, and game theory approaches. Third, we review and classify privacy-preserving technologies, including encryption, differential privacy, and policy confusion. We conclude the survey by discussing open issues and possible directions for future research in this field.},

However, these benchmarks are often flawed, and many aspects of common sense remain untested. Consequently, there is currently no reliable way of measuring to what extent existing AI systems have achieved these abilities.This article surveys the development and uses of AI commonsense benchmarks. It enumerates 139 commonsense benchmarks that have been developed: 102 text-based, 18 image-based, 12 video-based, and 7 based in simulated physical environments. It gives more detailed descriptions of twelve of these, three from each category. It surveys the various methods used to construct commonsense benchmarks. It discusses the nature of common sense, the role of common sense in AI, the goals served by constructing commonsense benchmarks, desirable features of commonsense benchmarks, and flaws and gap in existing benchmarks. It concludes with a number of recommendations for future development of commonsense AI benchmarks; most importantly, that the creators of benchmarks invest the work needed to ensure that benchmark examples are consistently high quality.},

For example, a teacher might write a grading spreadsheet to save time grading, or an interaction designer might use an interface builder to test some user interface design ideas. Although these end-user programmers may not have the same goals as professional developers, they do face many of the same software engineering challenges, including understanding their requirements, as well as making decisions about design, reuse, integration, testing, and debugging. This article summarizes and classifies research on these activities, defining the area of End-User Software Engineering (EUSE) and related terminology. The article then discusses empirical research about end-user software engineering activities and the technologies designed to support them. The article also addresses several crosscutting issues in the design of EUSE tools, including the roles of risk, reward, and domain complexity, and self-efficacy in the design of EUSE tools and the potential of educating users about software engineering principles.},

	abstract = {Video description is the automatic generation of natural language sentences that describe the contents of a given video. It has applications in human-robot interaction, helping the visually impaired and video subtitling. The past few years have seen a surge of research in this area due to the unprecedented success of deep learning in computer vision and natural language processing. Numerous methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics have been proposed in the literature, calling the need for a comprehensive survey to focus research efforts in this flourishing new direction. This article fills the gap by surveying the state-of-the-art approaches with a focus on deep learning models; comparing benchmark datasets in terms of their domains, number of classes, and repository size; and identifying the pros and cons of various evaluation metrics, such as SPICE, CIDEr, ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, and WMD. Classical video description approaches combined subject, object, and verb detection with template-based language models to generate sentences. However, the release of large datasets revealed that these methods cannot cope with the diversity in unconstrained open domain videos. Classical approaches were followed by a very short era of statistical methods that were soon replaced with deep learning, the current state-of-the-art in video description. Our survey shows that despite the fast-paced developments, video description research is still in its infancy due to the following reasons: Analysis of video description models is challenging, because it is difficult to ascertain the contributions towards accuracy or errors of the visual features and the adopted language model in the final description. Existing datasets neither contain adequate visual diversity nor complexity of linguistic structures. Finally, current evaluation metrics fall short of measuring the agreement between machine-generated descriptions with that of humans. We conclude our survey by listing promising future research directions.},

Next, we describe major approaches used for EHR mining, the metrics associated with EHRs, and the various study designs.

We review this recent progress as well as recent literature utilizing text mining in top IS journals to develop an outline for how future IS research can benefit from these new techniques. Our review of existing IS literature reveals that suboptimal text mining techniques are prevalent and that the more advanced TLMs could be applied to enhance and increase IS research involving text data, and to enable new IS research topics, thus creating more value for the research community. This is possible because these techniques make it easier to develop very powerful custom systems and their performance is superior to existing methods for a wide range of tasks and applications. Further, multilingual language models make possible higher quality text analytics for research in multiple languages. We also identify new avenues for IS research, like language user interfaces, that may offer even greater potential for future IS research.},

The successful use of auditory representations in this growing number of application scenarios has in turn prompted researchers to rediscover the more basic auditory representations and extend them in various directions. The goal of this article is to survey both classical auditory representations (e.g., auditory icons and earcons) and those auditory representations that have been created as extensions to earlier approaches, including speech-based sounds (e.g., spearcons and spindex representations), emotionally grounded sounds (e.g., auditory emoticons and spemoticons), and various other sound types used to provide sonifications in practical scenarios.

Third, we provide a comprehensive study of the potential security, privacy, and safety enhancements to existing systems based on the emergence of wearable technology. Although several research works have emerged exploring different offensive and defensive uses of wearables, there is a lack of a broad and precise literature review systematizing all those security and privacy aspects and the underlying threat models.

This is achieved only when methodologies are available to support integration across organizational and application boundaries.Methodologies for database design usually perform the design activity by separately producing several schemas, representing parts of the application, which are subsequently merged. Database schema integration is the activity of integrating the schemas of existing or proposed databases into a global, unified schema.The aim of the paper is to provide first a unifying framework for the problem of schema integration, then a comparative review of the work done thus far in this area. Such a framework, with the associated analysis of the existing approaches, provides a basis for identifying strengths and weaknesses of individual methodologies, as well as general guidelines for future improvements and extensions.},

Vlogs have gained much attention worldwide, especially with Google's acquisition of YouTube. This article presents a comprehensive survey of videoblogging (vlogging for short) as a new technological trend. We first summarize the technological challenges for vlogging as four key issues that need to be answered. Along with their respective possibilities, we give a review of the currently available techniques and tools supporting vlogging, and envision emerging technological directions for future vlogging. Several multimedia technologies are introduced to empower vlogging technology with better scalability, interactivity, searchability, and accessability, and to potentially reduce the legal, economic, and moral risks of vlogging applications. We also make an in-depth investigation of various vlog mining topics from a research perspective and present several incentive applications such as user-targeted video advertising and collective intelligence gaming. We believe that vlogging and its applications will bring new opportunities and drives to the research in related fields.},

The topical dimension (“what” the user is searching for) of these information needs is well studied; however, the intent dimension (“why” the user is searching) has received relatively less attention. Specifically, intent is the “immediate reason, purpose, or goal” that motivates a user to query a search engine. We present a thorough survey of multimedia information retrieval research directed at the problem of enabling search engines to respond to user intent. The survey begins by defining intent, including a differentiation from related, often-confused concepts. It then presents the key conceptual models of search intent. The core is an overview of intent-aware approaches that operate at each stage of the multimedia search engine pipeline (i.e., indexing, query processing, ranking). We discuss intent in conventional text-based search wherever it provides insight into multimedia search intent or intent-aware approaches. Finally, we identify and discuss the most important future challenges for intent-aware multimedia search engines. Facing these challenges will allow multimedia information retrieval to recognize and respond to user intent and, as a result, fully satisfy the information needs of users.},

	abstract = {Explanation-based learning (EBL) is a technique by which an intelligent system can learn by observing examples. EBL systems are characterized by the ability to create justified generalizations from single training instances. They are also distinguished by their reliance on background knowledge of the domain under study. Although EBL is usually viewed as a method for performing generalization, it can be viewed in other ways as well. In particular, EBL can be seen as a method that performs four different learning tasks: generalization, chunking, operationalization, and analogy.This paper provides a general introduction to the field of explanation-based learning. Considerable emphasis is placed on showing how EBL combines the four learning tasks mentioned above. The paper begins with a presentation of an intuitive example of the EBL technique. Subsequently EBL is placed in its historical context and the relation between EBL and other areas of machine learning is described. The major part of this paper is a survey of selected EBL programs, which have been chosen to show how EBL manifests each of the four learning tasks. Attempts to formalize the EBL technique are also briefly discussed. The paper concludes with a discussion of the limitations of EBL and the major open questions in the field.},
